# odin-recipes-2

This is the second time I try to follow up The Odin Project, so second time I do this project.
After I finish this, I should be able to do a very basic recipes website using HTML only.

After being finished (I think) with my first project, I can tell I missed so much from the lessons last time I tried this. I´m happy I´m redoing it. Results are less flashy this time, but I feel like I have a better understanding of what I´m doing, mostly with Git.
